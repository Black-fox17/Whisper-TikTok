If you were to fold a piece of paper in half repeatedly, the thickness of the paper would double with each fold, and you could continue folding it until the thickness of the paper is greater than the observable universe. Specifically, if you were to fold a standard piece of paper 103 times, the thickness of the paper would be greater than the distance from the Earth to the Sun (93 million miles). If you could somehow continue folding the paper 41 more times, the thickness of the paper would be greater than the estimated size of the observable universe, which is around 93 billion light-years across. This demonstrates the immense power of exponential growth and highlights how small things can become incredibly large given enough time and iterations.
