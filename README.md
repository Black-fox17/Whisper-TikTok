# ChatGPT-TikTok ü§ñüé•
ChatGPT-TikTok is an AI-powered tool for creating TikTok videos using OpenAI-ChatGPT,Edge TTS, OpenAI-Whisper and FFMPEG. It utilizes OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities to provide responses to prompts in various formats, including text and audio.

## How It Works
To use ChatGPT-TikTok, simply enter a prompt and wait for the AI model to generate a response. The response can then be used to create a TikTok video using the Microsoft Edge Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS) API.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è
ChatGPT-TikTok has been tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.8 and 3.9. To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
